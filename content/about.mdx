title: About Us
---
Paqmind platform is created and supported by a small team of **web development** enthusiasts.
In 2008 we envisioned web programming displacing desktop and becoming one of
the largest engineering disciplines. What happened since then? In [2012](https://github.blog/2015-08-19-language-trends-on-github/) 
JavaScript surpasses Java as the TOP-1 language at GitHub.com. At the end of [2018](https://statisticsanddata.org/data/the-most-popular-programming-languages-1965-2021/) 
JavaScript becomes the most used programming language according to StatisticsAndData.com. And few 
would argue that CSS is currently the most popular solution for making responsive UIs (across all devices).

Times change and now we more often hear about TypeScript â€“ a spiritual successor of JavaScript.
But with all new features of HTML and CSS, with all new Browser APIs, compilers, bundlers, builders
and whatnot it's still... Web Development. Very similar to what it was in 2007, when we started our careers.

The future likely belongs to WebAssembly and maybe at some point one of Compile-To-WASM languages
will substitute TypeScript. We actually hope and believe it, because the evolution of technology should never stop.
TypeScript is great but it only gets so far.

Our current interests lie in the intersection of statically typed languages, functional programming,
GraphQL, graph databases, autogenerated APIs, performance, and ML. We plan to blog much more about those topics
in the future.
