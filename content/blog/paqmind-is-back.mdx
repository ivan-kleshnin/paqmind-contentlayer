title: Web Development changes since 2020
intro: | 
  In web development, each year might feel like a decade. New tools, frameworks, services keep
  popping out at a freightening rate. We haven't blogged much since 2020, and now as we revive
  the platform, it's a good time to look back and see what changed in the industry over the past couple of years.

**Paqmind.com** is not the only platform we write for but we definitely haven't blogged a lot since 2020.
The reasons are typical and boring – work, family, lack of time... We were also splitting our efforts between
Russian and English content.

As of now we decided to keep blogging in English. Monolingual sites are so much easier to develop, support, 
and advertise. And most engineers have to know English anyway. So :raised_hand: to all native and non-native 
speakers reading us, and let's continue with the main topic of the post. Namely – what changed in 
the industry in recent years?

## Web Dev in retrospective :amphora:

I'll start earlier to provide more context. Web Development has been booming for the third decade. 
Here's a quick overview of the **key milestones** since the turn of the century:
- **2000: CSS** (W3C – first CSS drafts)
- **2004: Web 2.0** (visitors create content)
- **2006: PAAS** (AWS launches S3)
- **2006: SPA** (jQuery, first class interactivity)
- **2007: Mobile Web** (iPhone – new devices)
- **2008: Chrome** (Google – Webkit becomes the main browsing engine)
- **2008: SSG** (Jekyll, Front-Matter, GithubPages – pursuit for simplicity)
- **2008: Cloud** (Github – open source, collective development)
- **2009: Devops** (Devops movement gets traction)
- **2015: SSG + SPA hybrids** (Gatsby – pull content, not push)
- **2016: SSR** (NextJS – flexibility and SEO strike back)
- **2021: ISR** (NextJS – holy grail model for many projects)
- **2021: Web 3.0** (emerging since 2014 – decentralized resources)

Sorry for not mentioning your favorite thing :shrug:. It's a topic that can never be "fully covered".

And here we are **in 2022**, with the abundance of new tools, SAAS', PAAS', CMS', cryptocurrencies,
blockchains, neural networks, wearable devices, and whatnot... It was never so easy to implement many things that 
was scary to approach in the past. Yet at the same time there were never so many technologies 
and services to choose from. The [overchoice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overchoice) is a real thing.

## Frameworks :open_mouth:

One fast growing branch in this post-JavaScript world is... TypeScript frameworks.
Tell me about JS fatique one more time! Some good-ol players like Meteor and "modern classic" like NextJS
are not going to lose their positions. And at least a couple of new ones, if we count only those with novel ideas, appear each quarter.

The above is what I personally find the most interesting. Your preferences may vary.

After a quick review of each, Paqmind has decided to stay with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/blog) though. 
Vercel team has never disappointed as – they know their stuff. They roll up perfectly timed NextJS updates each couple of months. They hire the best 
programming minds in the world. And they won't have troubles to copy the best ideas from other frameworks
if necessary. After so many years of being a tech. reference it would be fair to copy others a bit,
for a difference.

## Other Trends :sparkles:

What else is going on with Web Development, besides new frameworks? I would highlight the following trends:
- **Blockchains** (Web 3.0, NFT)
- **Content** (MDX, headless CMS')
- **ML/AI** (QA, analytics, coding assistance)
- **Low Code** (visual programming, high-level tools, SAAS)
- **Performance** (zero-size JS bundle)
- **Static Types** (TypeScript, GraphQL, typed APIs)

You'll likely find at least one of the above (or related) buzzwords mentioned in any newer 
software product!

I've spend the most time exploring Low Code & Headless CMS' topics so here are my top picks:

Again, some are well-known veterans of the industry and some are their challengers. I'd like 
to say something smart about Web 3 and so on, but I'm simply not competent there.

It's sometimes hard to draw a line between a Headless CMS and a Database. Should you choose DGraph
which provides an out-of-the-box GraphQL API and supports authentication or should you prefer GraphCMS?
Sure, they are different enough, but selling points and features overlap way too much to ignore
similarities. 

Here are my personal watch-list of databases (and closely related things like ORMs, etc):

<Group my="1.5rem">
![Prisma](https://img.shields.io/badge/Prisma-3982CE?style=for-the-badge&logo=Prisma&logoColor=white)
![Neo4J](https://img.shields.io/badge/Neo4j-008CC1?style=for-the-badge&logo=neo4j&logoColor=white)

![Nebula](https://img.shields.io/badge/Neo4j-violet?style=for-the-badge)
</Group>

I'm happy to see that Neo4J gets official [GraphQL support](https://neo4j.com/developer/graphql/) in a form of library.
I always liked Cypher and now (as I've seen new [monstrocities](shttps://www.sanity.io/docs/groq-syntax))
I started to appreciate Neo4J and its contributions to the industry even more.

## Contentlayer :fire:

[Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) is one of the most promising new tools. I swear by it.
It's a framework- and datasource-agnostic tool that you can use to add MDX support to your blog. 
And no, NextJS' support of MDX is not that great.

Contentlayer also features out-of-the-box Prisma code highlighting and support for Remark/Rehype plugin ecosystem. 
All those little bells and whistles.

> My sisters' friends' "investments".

Have you noticed the **typography quotes**? :smiling_face_with_3_hearts:
While all the symbols in the code stay untouched:

```
console.log("Test: my sisters' friends' investments")
```

The above emoji is also automated and shorcoded `:smiling_face_with_3_hearts:`. It's not a copy-pasted
unicode character which can break when collaborating! Can you see why I called 2022 a Great year for us?!

## Mantine :lipstick:

The last tool I'd like to give a special mention is [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/). Component libraries
are probably among the most time-consuming software projects (it's never enough widgets and features). 
Some tools have progressed significantly in recent years. For example, [Material UI](https://mui.com/) was rewritten from JSS to Emotion
and now feels much more comfortable to use. Some tools continued to grow steadily, like [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/).
And finally there're some new players like Mantine which we selected to style this blog. It's a new
library developed by a single person but the quality and quantity of components is outstanding. Mantine
is based on Emotion and therefore positions itself as a direct MUI alternative.

MUI is very solid and mature styleguide but it's getting overused so we decided to try something fresh.
We've made a comparison table where Mantine looked much better than Chakra: more widgets, hooks, helpers
and all that for free. So we decided to give it a go and have no regrets so far.

Don't be fooled – it's a very new tool and you'll have to hack around minor issues. But mostly
visual, I'm yet to encounter a serious bug yet. Not recommending it for commercial products though,
because there's no solid community yet. And we know [what happens](https://elm-lang.org/) when an
otherwise great project fails at community making. On the flip side, Mantine's sources are among the most
readable of what I seen (compare to MUI, dear) so you shouldn't have troubles if you'll need to fork
them and support for some time.

## Links :chains:

Some articles you may find interesting. What I find the most remarkable is how products of different
categories get more and more comparable, eventually becoming competitors to each other:
